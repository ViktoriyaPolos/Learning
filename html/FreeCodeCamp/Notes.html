<!--
<fieldset> 
Is used to group related form elements together and create a visual separation from other parts of the form. It is typically used to group 
form controls such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and input fields. A <legend> element can be used as the first child of the <fieldset> 
element to provide a label or caption for the group.

<section>
Is used to group related content together, regardless of whether it's form-related or not. It is used to divide content into distinct 
sections, which can help with organization and readability. It is typically used to group together a set of related <article>, <header>, 
and/or <footer> elements, for example.

<label> 
Is used in HTML to associate a textual label with a form control, such as a text input, a checkbox, or a radio button. The purpose of a 
<label> element is to provide a description or caption for the form control, which can improve the usability and accessibility of the form.
When a <label> element is clicked, it sets the focus to the associated form control, making it easier for users to interact with the form.
