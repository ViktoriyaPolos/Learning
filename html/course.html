<!-- Coments are done this way-->

<!-- Tags
What we need to know here is that we can have tags with body or without. The structure is: <to_open>optional body of the tag</to_close>. 'Non bodied' ones are, for example
<meta />, <input /> - here the / to close is optional.
Also, we can define our own tags, besides the ones HTML already 'provides'-->
