<!--
Options of 'sections' in body:
<h1></h1>
Header, goes from 1-6 and decreases in importance the higher you go. Can have headers inside another header.

<ul></ul> & <ol></ol>
Unordered and ordered lists. For the inputs, it's the same for both: <li>random list item</li> 

<figure></figure>
Allows to add an imagine (<img></img>) and a legend for the image (<figcaption></figcaption>)

<fieldset></fieldset> 
Is used to group related form elements together and create a visual separation from other parts of the form. It is typically used to group 
form controls such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and input fields. A <legend> element can be used as the first child of the <fieldset> 
element to provide a label or caption for the group.

<section></section>
Is used to group related content together, regardless of whether it's form-related or not. It is used to divide content into distinct 
sections, which can help with organization and readability. It is typically used to group together a set of related <article>, <header>, 
and/or <footer> elements, for example.

<label></label> 
Is used in HTML to associate a textual label with a form control, such as a text input, a checkbox, or a radio button. The purpose of a 
<label> element is to provide a description or caption for the form control, which can improve the usability and accessibility of the form.
When a <label> element is clicked, it sets the focus to the associated form control, making it easier for users to interact with the form.

<div></div>
Generic container element that does not convey any semantic meaning. It is used for grouping together related content for styling or 
scripting purposes, and is often used as a building block for creating layout structures on a webpage.

<nav></nav>

<table></table>

    - <caption></caption> 
      Should always be the first child of a table to describe what the table is about. Can be positioned with the caption-side CSS property.
    - <thead></thead>
      Used to indicate the header of the table
    - <tbody></tbody>
      Used to indicate the main portion of the table
    - <tr></tr>
      Table row. Within it we can add <td></td> - data cell and <th></th> - header cell

<span></span>
An inline container used to mark up a section of text or a small inline portion of a document. It doesn't add any semantic meaning or 
affect the structure of the document. Instead, it is primarily used to apply styling or to target specific sections of text for 
manipulation through CSS or JavaScript.

<form action=""></form>
1. Serves as a container for form controls such as input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and buttons.
2. The action attribute of the <form> element specifies the URL or server-side script that will handle the form data when it is submitted.
3. The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET 
request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
4. <input> elements are used to create input fields for text, password, email, number, date, and more. Each input field typically has a 
name attribute to identify it when the form is submitted.
    - can use 'required' to make the field mandatory
    - pattern: used to define certain requirements, for example for passwords (pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" - means regular expression which 
    matches 8 or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5)
    - if we name 2 inputs type=radio (name="x") the same thing it will allow only for one of them to be selected (makes them related)
5. <label> element is used to associate a text label with an input field. It improves accessibility and usability by providing a 
description or caption for the input.
    - the inputs are included in the label elements
    - so can be the 'select' elements. These allow for 'textarea' elements, which are like an input text but allow for several columns 
    (cols) and rows (rows), making it a big empty box to write in.
6. The <input> element with the type="submit" attribute or a <button> element with the type="submit" attribute is used to create a button 
that submits the form data to the server.
7. Handling Form Data: When the form is submitted, the browser sends the form data to the URL specified in the action attribute using the 
HTTP method specified in the method attribute. The server-side script or endpoint defined in the action processes the data and may 
generate a response.

Accessebility
role (seen inside a 'section' - 09)

technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.
    - role="region"
        a. aria-labelledby=""

'Hacks'
